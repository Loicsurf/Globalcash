[18:42, 4/16/2020] Lucha: GLOBAL CASH SERVICES. 
      We have the dream of growing so we would creat a forum to teach youths on business. 
   We are currently doing interviews,we interview shop and stall owners to have better information about business. 
     We would definitely open offices in the different regions of cameroon to ease the work
      Having in mind poverty is a social malaise we aim of reducing it by employing the youths n praying the Government reduce the tax
     One of our aim is to creat different businesses to keep the youths busy
